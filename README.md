# Personal_Poject_Machine_Lerning
A personal project in which I use machine learning algorithms to determine if a person is at risk of heart disease.

In the project, data points with values that are impossible in reality were found. Two strategies were implemented: the first was to remove these data points, and the second was to impute the mean for the fields with errors. The models were then trained using the two resulting datasets (cleaned and meaned) from these strategies, and the results and best performing models are presented.
